# Game System

Many different things can occur during a _Mythras Imperative_ game. Some are resolved through skill use or one of the major game mechanics such as combat or magic; others require their own rules for adjudication. This chapter provides rules and guidance for a variety of different scenarios that players will encounter while playing the game.

The list is not exhaustive but should represent the most common situations. If Games Masters find there are other situations that require some form of game system adjudication, and that these situations seem to occur frequently, then they are encouraged to develop their own rules to cover these special circumstances, using those given in this chapter as a basis for replication or development.

## Asphyxiation

Characters can hold their breath for a number of seconds equal to their Endurance skill. However, the character must be prepared (filling the lungs with as much air as possible); if not, then the period is halved if the character was in a passive situation, or reduced to one-fifth if the character was engaged in strenuous activity.

Once the period of held breath is over, characters must make an Endurance roll:

- If the roll is a Critical Success, no further deterioration occurs.
- If the roll is Successful, the character accrues an extra level of Fatigue.
- If the roll Fails, the character sustains 1d2 extra levels of Fatigue that Round.
- If the roll is Fumbled, the character sustains 1d3 extra levels of Fatigue that Round.

Without aid, death from Asphyxiation is usually swift. If the Asphyxiation ends before the character dies, they recover Fatigue levels lost to suffocation relatively quickly, regaining one level per minute.

Depending on the method of Asphyxiation, the Games Master may wish to prevent full recovery, imposing an enduring level of Fatigue (refer to the section on [Fatigue](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0004_Game_System?id=fatigue)) to represent damage to the lungs caused by smoke or water inhalation.

## Character Improvement

Every _Mythras Imperative_ character can improve with time and experience. Improvement can be undertaken in several areas:

- Increasing existing skills
- Increasing Passions
- Learning new skills
- Learning new Abilities

### Experience Rolls

The mechanism for most character improvement is the Experience Roll. Games Masters dispense Experience Rolls at an appropriate juncture in the campaign: at the end of every successful scenario or storyline; or after perhaps two or three sessions of play if the story is a long one which will take time to complete. The frequency is at the Games Master's discretion. A high frequency of Experience Rolls will lead to the characters developing at a faster rate.

There is no right or wrong time to give Experience Rolls, but natural breaks in the story may suggest suitable times. The Games Master is, however, always the decision maker here. While players cannot demand Experience Rolls, they have a right to expect them at certain points – as their characters will not be able to develop without them.

The number of Experience Rolls awarded is also determined by the Games Master. However, a good rule of thumb is 1-3 Experience Rolls per session since the last time they were awarded.

### Increasing Existing Skills

Any skill on the Character Sheet, Standard or Professional, can be increased by spending one Experience Roll. Players can elect not to spend Experience Rolls on increasing skills, instead building up a stockpile for use in increasing other things – such as Class abilities (see below).

The player rolls 1d100 and compares it to the skill being increased. The character's INT is added to the roll.

- If the number rolled is equal to or greater than the skill being improved, it increases by 1d4+1%.
- If the number rolled is less than the skill selected, the skill still increases, but only by 1%.
- If a character Fumbled any skill during the preceding session(s) – i.e., between the last set of Experience Rolls and the present one – the Fumbled skill gains a free increase of 1%. We learn more from our mistakes than our successes and this represents the reflection a character undergoes following a disastrous failure. Multiple Fumbles of the same skill do not stack. In a case where the Fumbled skill is also being raised with an Experience Roll, the 1% from the Fumble is applied before the roll is made to improve it.

The same skill may not benefit from more than one Experience Roll per session.

### Increasing Passions

As described under Passions in the [Passions](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0002_Characters?id=step-8-passions) section, the value of a Passion may be increased with Experience Rolls in the same way as a skill. If supported by play, the Games Master might even allow a Passion to be reduced using an Experience Roll.

_For example, constant spurning from an unrequited love might eventually wear down the Passion of even the most ardent lover, especially one who wishes to pursue a relationship without the ghosts of the past haunting them._

### Learning New Skills

Some characters may wish to study new Professional Skills which they never had the chance to learn from their culture. Before they can start investing Experience Rolls, they must first find a source of knowledge from which to learn. This could be as prosaic as a professional tutor such as those provided by orders or guilds. Alternately it might be a more exotic source of education such as an ancient and crumbling training scroll.

Once a source of education is found, the character must spend an entire month of study and practice to garner a basic grounding in that skill (learn at Base Level). This costs 3 Experience Rolls plus whatever in-game costs are required to pay the teacher (if one exists) and purchase (or rent) whatever equipment and tools may be needed.

## Disease and Poison

Some of the most feared things which can affect characters are the myriad diseases and poisons which infest the dark and grim places of the world. There's nothing quite more unsettling than a plague which strikes the character's home city, especially when they are still within its gates. Likewise finding a venomous serpent in the bed or being attacked by giant scorpions can be moments of high drama.

Diseases and poisons are near infinite in their varieties but, for game purposes, are handled in the same way.

### Disease and Poison Traits

All diseases and poisons manifest a number of traits important to their effects.

_**Application**_ – The method of how the disease or poison is introduced into the victim.

- _**Ingestion**_ – Effects take place through either eating or drinking.

- _**Inhaled**_ – Effects take place through breathing or snorting.

- _**Contact**_ – Effects take place through absorption through the skin.

- _**Injected**_ – Effects take place when the substance is injected into the body through piercing.

_**Potency**_: The virulence of the disease or poison. This value is set against an appropriate resisting skill (usually Endurance or Willpower) in an Opposed Roll. If the character wins the roll, they shrug off its effects. If they lose the roll, then they suffer all of the disease or poison Conditions, each at the appropriate time.

_**Resistance**_: How the disease or poison is resisted – usually either Endurance or Willpower, but may have more exotic resistance requirements. Resistance can be rolled at the time of exposure or deferred until the Onset Time to conceal the fact the character might have been infected or poisoned.

_**Onset Time**_: Many diseases and poisons do not take immediate effect. The delay is called the Onset Time, and this can be a matter of seconds, minutes, hours, or even longer. Poisons or diseases possessing multiple effects may have different onset times for each one as described under Conditions.

_**Duration**_: How long a disease or poison's Conditions last.

_**Conditions**_: Every toxin has one or more Conditions. These have specific effects as described in the Conditions table, below, and if a victim fails to resist, he suffers all the Conditions described.

_**Antidote/Cure**_: If the toxin can be treated it will be noted here. Successful treatment prevents any further conditions from occurring, yet in some circumstances may leave the victim suffering enduring effects that have already been inflicted.

**Conditions Table**

| **Condition** | **Effects** |
| :-- | :-- |
| Agony | The victim is hindered by intense pain. Whether in a location or the entire body, any skill roll involving use of the affected area must also be less or equal to the character's Willpower, otherwise the attempt fails, and they moan or scream in pain. |
| Asphyxiation | The victim  suffers asphyxiation – he collapses incapacitated, unable to breathe. The rules from the  [Asphyxiation](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0004_Game_System?id=asphyxiation) section are used. Asphyxiation may be asthmatic in nature meaning the victim only suffers shortness of breath, or complete respiratory failure resulting in death. In the latter case a victim can be kept alive by winning an opposed test of the First Aid skill against the Potency of the disease or poison. |
| Bleeding | The victim suffers from either internal bleeding or surface hemorrhaging which leads to the Fatigue and recovery times described under the [Fatigue](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0004_Game_System?id=fatigue) and [Blood Loss](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0004_Game_System?id=blood-loss) sections below. |
| Contagious | The victim can transfer the poison or disease by touch. |
| Death | The victim collapses incapacitated and dies after a number of rounds equal to their CON characteristic. |
| Fever | The victim's body temperature fluctuates wildly – from hot to cold – and muscles ache. All skills suffer a difficulty grade of Hard. |
| Mania | The victim is driven to follow some compulsion, such as avoiding water, paranoia, self-mutilation, and so forth. The mania induced by the disease or poison will be noted in its description. |
| Nausea | The victim cannot eat, and must roll against his Endurance every time he performs a stressful physical action to avoid being physically sick. Vomiting lasts for 1d3 rounds during which he cannot act. Long durations of Nausea may cause starvation. |
| Paralysis | The victim is physically unable to move. The affected area, if a location, cannot be used for the duration. If it affects the whole body, the character cannot move at all. |

#### Sample Disease: Red Pox

Red pox is a nasty disease spread by skin contact with a person already infected, or with something they have touched. The chance of catching the disease from an object remains for 1d3 days after contact, making it quite difficult to contain the disease once an outbreak occurs.

Victims initially suffer a minor rash, but within a day come down with a serious fever which usually renders them bedridden for the entire duration. During this time, the rash evolves into gruesomely itchy pustules which burst open at the slightest movement, weeping small trickles of blood – especially from the armpits and groin. This stage can last up to a week or more, potentially proving fatal.

- Application: Contact
- Potency: 50
- Resistance: Endurance
- Onset time: 1d6+6 hours
- Duration: 1d6+3 days
- Conditions: Once the disease manifests the victim becomes Contagious. 1 day later they begin to suffer Fever and Bleeding. Each day the pustules weep blood the victim loses one level of Fatigue, which does not recover until the duration of the disease has completed.
- Antidote/Cure: Can be cured by the Healing skill.

## Falling

The amount of damage suffered in a fall depends on the distance of the drop. Armor Points do not reduce falling damage, but the Damage Modifier of the falling character or creature applies to the damage suffered from the fall.

**Falling Distance Table**

| **Distance Fallen** | **Damage Taken** |
| :-- | :-- |
| **1 metre or less** | No damage. |
| **2-5 metres** | 1d6 points of damage to one random location. |
| **6-10 metres** | 2d6 points of damage to two random locations. |
| **11-15 metres** | 3d6 points of damage to three random locations. |
| **16-20 metres** | 4d6 points of damage to four random locations. |
| **Each +5 metres** | +1d6 damage. |

### Falling Objects

A falling object imparts an amount of damage based on its SIZ and the distance of the fall. An object imparts 1d6 damage for every 6 points of SIZ (or fraction thereof), plus an amount of damage equal to the Damage Taken column of the Falling Distance Table – including any reductions for objects of smaller size.

## Fatigue

Fatigue measures tiredness and its incremental effects. It is used to track many different things, from strenuous activity to the debilitating effects of disease.

The primary way of accruing Fatigue is by engaging in some form of physical activity. The more arduous the exercise or work, the more quickly it tires the character. At the Games Master's discretion, characters must make an appropriate skill roll – either Athletics, Brawn, or Endurance – to resist gaining a level of Fatigue.

Every Failed roll accrues a level of Fatigue. Each level of Fatigue carries penalties for skill use, movement, Initiative, and Action Points. Asphyxiation, Blood Loss, and other setting dependent effects also contribute to Fatigue accrual.

For most characters, activities of any kind become near impossible when the level of Incapacitated is reached. At this stage, the character is still conscious but incapable of anything but the most desperate of activities.

Beyond Incapacitated, characters cannot act at all. The Fatigue levels – Semi-Conscious, Comatose, and Dead – are generally reserved for measuring the most extreme effects of suffocation, disease, blood loss, starvation, exposure, and so forth.

### Recovering from Fatigue

Characters recover from Fatigue depending on their Healing Rate. The amount of complete rest needed to recover from each level of accrued Fatigue is equal to the Recovery Period divided by the character's Healing Rate.

Note that the table below represents Fatigue recovery for physical exertion. Fatigue recovery can be much faster when recovering from Asphyxiation or slower if recuperating from Blood Loss.

**Fatigue Levels**

| **Fatigue Level** | **Skill Grade** | **Movement** | **Initiative** | **Action Points** | **Recovery Period** |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Fresh | – | – | No Penalties | – | – |
| Winded | Hard | No Penalties | No Penalties | No Penalties | 15 minutes |
| Tired | Hard | -1 metre | No Penalties | No Penalties | 3 hours |
| Wearied | Formidable | -2 metres | -2 | No Penalties | 6 hours |
| Exhausted | Formidable | Halved | -4 | -1 | 12 hours |
| Debilitated | Herculean | Halved | -6 | -2 | 18 hours |
| Incapacitated | Herculean | Immobile | -8 | -3 | 24 hours |
| Semi-Conscious | Hopeless | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | 36 hours |
| Comatose | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | 48 hours |
| Dead | Dead | – | – | – | Never |

## Fires

Fires are always a source of danger when used as a weapon or raging out of control. The Fire Intensity table below gives five different intensities for heat damage, with some examples. The damage inflicted per Round is given in the Damage column. Being relatively small, Intensity 1 and 2 sources apply their damage to a single Hit Location, usually that touching the source. Intensity 3 and 4 sources are larger, applying damage to the nearest 1d4+1 Hit Locations, indicating the degree of radiant heat. Intensity 5 sources affect all Hit Locations simultaneously.

Fire can ignite flammable materials. If not extinguished immediately such materials combust within a number of Rounds as indicated by the fire's Intensity. Once ignited, flammable materials burn until physically extinguished. Damage is applied directly to the Hit Points of the material, ignoring Armor Points, and to any flesh beneath. If left. uncontrolled it spreads to a number of Hit Locations, per Round, equal to its Intensity.

**Fire Intensity Table**

| Intensity | Examples | Time to Ignite | Damage |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Candle | 1d4 | 1d2 |
| 2 | Torch | 1d3 | 1d4 |
| 3 | Campfire | 1d2 | 1d6 |
| 4 | Room-filling conflagration | 1d2 | 2d6 |
| 5 | Volcanic lava | Instant | 3d6 |

Fire-based attacks typically have a percentage chance of igniting flammable materials as they are generally over in a single Round. Unless otherwise noted, this chance is damage rolled x5% for fire-based attacks, and damage rolled x1% for electrical. Once ignited, flammable materials burn for 1d3-1 damage every Round until physically extinguished. Apply this damage directly to the Hit Points of the material, ignoring Armor Points, and to any flesh beneath. A creature's natural Armor offers its normal protection, however. The victim may attempt to smother the flames by dropping prone and making a successful Athletics roll, which requires an Action Point and may be attempted each Turn. If others assist in smothering the flames in some way, the roll is one Difficulty Grade easier. If the damage roll results in zero damage, the fire has gone out on its own in that one location. For each location that had gone out on its own, the roll to smother the flames is also one Difficulty Grade easier.

## Game Time

In _Mythras Imperative_, time is an important factor, mostly to determine what happens in what order, so that game mechanics are applied when they should be. Remember that in-game time is usually not equivalent to time spent playing. Sometimes, the GM may need to summarize the events of many days in a single sentence, such as 'It takes you a week to reach Castle Anthrax,' while at other times, particularly during combat, the actions of only a few seconds of time can take several minutes or longer to resolve.

Following are the important distinctions of game time:

### Combat Rounds

A Combat Round represents five seconds of real time. They are used to measure short, frenetic bursts of activity that take moments to complete or measuring very detailed activities that require a blow-by-blow resolution. For example, a chase between hunter and prey where each Round determines the twists and turns of the pursuit.

### Skill Time

Skill Time represents a few minutes to a few hours and is used to measure activities that do not require the detailed attention of a Combat Round but require a specific deliberation of effort with a definite result. Picking a lock might take five minutes, whereas observing the patrols made by teams of guards around a castle's walls might require several hours and are both examples of Skill Time.

### Narrative Time

This is the amount of time taken when the Games Master is narrating to the players, or when the players are discussing. Unless there is a specific reason for it, most actual roleplaying takes place in narrative time. When roleplaying, narrative time resembles real time, where a conversation takes as long to have as it takes to play. If a game session includes lengthy travel, or periods of activity where exact time is not of the essence, then time is compressed greatly to a few moments of game time.

## Hit Locations

Most successful (weapon) attacks land on a specific Hit Location. This can be determined randomly or in some circumstances be selected by Special Effects such as Choose Location. To randomly calculate which location is been hit, roll 1d20 and compare the number rolled with the relevant humanoid or creature Hit Location table.

Animals and monsters usually have slightly different Hit Location tables than humanoids to reflect their own unique physiology. These are listed as part of each being's description and is typically only of use to the Games Master.

The humanoid Hit Location table is repeated here for ease of reference.

#### Humanoid Hit Locations

| 1d20 | Hit Location |
| :-: | :-- |
| 1-3 | Right Leg |
| 4-6 | Left Leg |
| 7-9 | Abdomen |
| 10-12 | Chest |
| 13-15 | Right Arm |
| 16-18 | Left Arm |
| 19-20 | Head |

Note that some attacks, especially magical, technological or those produced by particular monsters (a dragon's fiery breath or an exploding grenade for example), may strike several Hit Locations simultaneously. Individual Hit Locations may be armored, either from worn protection or the natural toughness of the creature's outer surface. This is important when considering Damage and Wound Levels below.

### Damage and Wound Levels

If an attack strikes successfully, it causes damage according to the damage rating for the weapon. A shortsword, for instance, inflicts 1d6 damage.

The rolled damage for the weapon or attack is modified by the certain conditions in the specific following order:

1. Apply the Damage Modifier for the character making the attack.
2. Modify the damage from any weapon enhancing (or reducing) magic.
3. If parried, reduce the damage appropriately as per the comparative weapon sizes.
4. If the Hit Location is armored, reduce damage by the Armor Points value.

If the damage inflicted by the attack is above zero, then the Hit Location sustains that amount of damage, with the damage total being immediately removed from the location's Hit Points. Note how many Hit Points the location has remaining, and the wound category that results.

- _**Minor Wound**_: Hit Location still has positive Hit Points
- _**Serious Wound**_: Hit Location is reduced to zero Hit Points or below.
- _**Major Wound**_: Hit Location is reduced to a negative score equal or greater than its starting Hit Points

Use the following rules if a location receives a Serious or Major Wound. Note that wounds requiring Endurance checks test them in an Opposed Roll against the value of the original attack roll. This reflects the ability of highly skilled warriors to make more deadly strikes. Endurance rolls are not repeated unless the location is wounded again.

### Minor Wound

Minor wounds are cuts, scratches, bruises, and sprains. They hurt, may bleed, but are not significant enough to slow down or hamper the victim.

### Serious Wound

If a location is reduced to zero Hit Points or below, the victim receives a Serious Wound. The location is permanently scarred, and the victim cannot attack or start to cast spells (but can still Parry or Evade) for the next 1d3 Turns due to being stunned or distracted by the pain of the wound.

A character suffering a Serious Wound to a limb must immediately make an Opposed Roll of his Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in the limb being rendered useless, until the location is restored to positive Hit Points. If a leg, the victim drops prone. If an arm, whatever is being held drops, unless the object is strapped on (use common sense here).

A character suffering a Serious Wound to the abdomen, chest, or head must immediately make an Opposed Roll of his Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in unconsciousness for a number of minutes equal to the amount of damage sustained in the attack causing the Serious Wound. The First Aid or Healing skills can be used to help an unconscious victim back to consciousness.

At the Games Master's discretion, even if the character remains functional, all tasks requiring use of that Hit Location will suffer an ongoing penalty of one Difficulty Grade, until the injury is reduced to a Minor Wound.

### Major Wound

If a location is reduced to a negative score equal to or greater than its starting Hit Points, the character receives a Major Wound. The character is immediately Incapacitated, unable to continue fighting. A limb is severed, transfixed, shattered, or ripped off by a Major Wound. The character drops prone, physically Incapacitated, and must immediately make an Opposed Roll of Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in unconsciousness from the agony. If a severed, punctured, or ripped off location is not treated within a number of minutes equal to five times his Healing Rate, the character dies from blood loss and shock.

The victim of a Major Wound to the abdomen, chest, or head drops unconscious, totally Incapacitated, and must immediately make an Opposed Roll of Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in an instant and gratuitous death (decapitated, chopped in half, impaled through the heart, torn apart, and so forth). If they survive, and the location is not treated within a number of Combat Rounds equal to twice the character's Healing Rate, they still die from blood loss and shock.

Since most Major Wounds require some form of surgery or significant magic to heal, the sufferer will be very unlikely to recover from a Major Wound in time to rejoin combat. Depending on the available treatment, the wounded location will be potentially maimed (see [Healing from Injury](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0004_Game_System?id=healing-from-injury) below).

### Blood Loss

Blood Loss due to external and internal wounds, usually sustained in combat, can wear a character down very quickly. Its effects are measured by the accumulation of Fatigue levels, much like Asphyxiation. Unrestrained Blood Loss typically results in death without some form of medical attention. Unlike Asphyxiation, the effects of serious Blood Loss on Fatigue are enduring. A character recovers Fatigue lost to bleeding at a rate of one level per day, starting the day after his exsanguinations cease.

### Heroic Last Actions

In special cases where key characters receive a Major Wound, the Games Master might allow a heroic last action – such as spitting out one last spell, attempting to cut down their slayer, crawling away to hide, or trying to tourniquet their own wound. They must have working limbs applicable to the Action and burn a Luck Point. They get a single opportunity to attempt their Action, and then immediately collapse into unconsciousness, and probable death.

## Healing from Injury

Natural healing from wounds and injuries is based on the character's Healing Rate. The Healing Rate dictates how many Hit Points are recovered in a location depending on the injury's nature:

- _**Minor Wounds**_: Days

- _**Serious Wounds**_: Weeks

- _**Major Wounds**_: Months

Thus, a character with a Healing Rate of 3 who suffers damage taking him to –3 in a Hit Location, a Serious Wound, will heal naturally at a rate of 3 Hit Points per week until his wound goes above zero, and then heal 3 Hit Points per day until fully recovered.

There are certain restrictions on natural healing:

- The healing character cannot engage in strenuous activity: otherwise, the Healing Rate is reduced by 1d3. Thus, a character recovering from even a Minor Wound could find his progress halted if they decide to engage in any physical tasks that might exacerbate the injuries.
- Natural healing will not begin to heal a Major Wound until the victim has been treated with a successful Healing roll, or the casting of some form of healing magic. Non-dismembering Major Wounds which are not treated within a number of days equal to one twentieth of the Healing skill become maimed, permanently reducing the Hit Points of the location.

## Inanimate Objects

All inanimate objects possess Armor Points and Hit Points which are used to determine resistance to damage and destruction. Armor Points reduce damage before Hit Points are affected. Once an object's Hit Points have been reduced to zero, it is useless.

Breakage attempts require a character to make a Brawn, Unarmed or Combat Style roll, as appropriate, to inflict damage. A success deals damage to the item.

### Weapons vs Inanimate Objects

Using a weapon against an inanimate object with Armor Points equal to or greater than those of the weapon deals damage to both the object and the weapon. For instance, using an axe on an iron door may damage the door, but the axe itself will be destroyed long before the iron door is. The Games Master should exercise discretion on which weapons or tools can affect which objects. A chisel, for example, is explicitly designed to carve wood or stone whilst a sword, although sharp, is not. The chisel would therefore not take damage from something it is attempting to carve whereas a sword most likely would.

**Inanimate Objects**

| Object | Armor / Hit Points |
| :-- | :-: |
| Castle Gate | 8/150 |
| Castle Wall | 10/500 |
| Chain/Shackle | 8/8 |
| Iron Post | 8/15 |
| Glass Window | 1/4 |
| Iron Door | 12/30 |
| Rope | 6/3 |
| Wooden Chair | 4/15 |
| Brick Wall | 6/30 |
| Concrete Wall | 8/40 |
| Automobile | 6/30 |
| Bulletproof Glass | 8/25 |
| Steel Beam | 12/50 |
| Armored Personnel Carrier | 10/50 |
| Battle Tank | 15/100 |
| Truck/Excavator | 8/40 |
| Tree Trunk | 6/50 |

## Luck Points

Luck Points help differentiate heroes from the rank and file. They represent a character's ability to potentially turn failure into success and even cheat death.

Luck Points can be used during play and, at the beginning of the next session, replenish to their usual value.

### Using Luck Points

Luck points can be used in a variety of ways. Only one Luck Point can be used in support of a particular Action. Luck Points cannot be spent on Experience or Training rolls. Each of the following options costs a single Luck Point.

#### Cheat Fate

Characters can use a Luck Point to re-roll or swap (a 75 would become a 57 for example) any dice roll they make. This can be a skill roll, damage roll, or anything else that has some effect. Characters can even force an opponent to re-roll an attack or damage roll made against them.

#### Desperate Effort

If a character has exhausted their Action Points during a fight and needs to find that last burst of desperate energy to perhaps avoid a messy demise, they may spend a Luck Point to gain an additional Action Point.

#### Mitigate Damage

A character who suffers a Major Wound may spend a Luck Point to downgrade the injury to a Serious Wound. This reduces the damage taken to one Hit Point less than what would be required to inflict a Major Wound.
