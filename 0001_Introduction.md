# Mythras Imperative System Resource Document

---
## Introduction

_Mythras Imperative_ is an Open, ORC Licensed, version of the _Mythras_ ruleset. This document offers a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, set of rules, including character creation, skills, rules for certain typical situations, combat, and magic – more than enough to get both players and Games Masters started, and form a solid basis for further development. _Mythras Imperative_ is compatible with the Mythras core rules, and other ORC licensed percentile gaming systems. Its companion volume, _Classic Fantasy Imperative,_ is also completely compatible and released under ORC, meaning that the two Imperatives can be easily combined.

## New to d100?

_Mythras Imperative_ is a d100 or percentile system. Percentile dice, or 1d100, are used to resolve key actions – skill use, combat, magic casting, and so on. It is a roll-under system, meaning that the target number is expressed as a percentage (Athletics 65%, for instance), and both the Games Master and player are looking to roll equal to or less than this target number, using 1d100, to achieve a Success. It is quite easy to replace the 1d100 with a d20 if preferred, and all percentages can be divided by 5 (round up) to gain the target number for a d20 roll. Athletics 65% would become Athletics 13, in our example.

However, 1d100 offers a great deal of flexibility and nuance that underpins the whole game, so our recommendation is to try the 1d100 approach first. While it may seem counterintuitive to have to roll _less_ than something (in many games, higher is usually better!), having a target number expressed as a percentage range that one needs to roll within makes it easy and simple to see your chances of success, and allows for quite a few 'dice tricks,' such as Opposed Rolls, Criticals and Fumbles, and a few other things explored later in these rules. Percentile roleplaying has been around since the earliest days of roleplaying and is a firmly established game system with a tried and tested core mechanic that is flexible, intuitive, and tends to fade into the background during play.

## Simplification

Long time owners of _**Mythras**_ will note that in some places the _Mythras Imperative_ rules have been simplified. This has been done so that a Games Master may more quickly introduce the game to new players with a minimum of fuss.

## Rounding of Numbers and Results

On some occasions you will be required to divide numbers – typically the rating in a skill (such as for determining a Critical Success, which is 1/10th of the skill's value). Whenever a division result creates a fraction, always round up to the whole number. So, for instance, 1/10th of 63% is 6.3; this is rounded up to 7.

## Dice Used

_Mythras Imperative_ uses the standard polyhedral dice set: d4, d6, d8, d10 d12, d20 and d100. Additionally, the following dice are called for:

d2: Roll any die. An odds number equals 1 and evens equals 2. Or flip a coin.

d3: Roll a six-sided die; 1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2, 5-6 = 3
