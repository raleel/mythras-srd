# Characters

Every player in _Mythras Imperative_ controls a character. A character is the player's alter-ego, and is usually very different, physically, and mentally, to the player. Characters can be from a variety of races, according to the setting for the game; a historical setting would feature just humans, whereas a fantasy setting could involve dwarves, elves and even lizardmen. The basic character is defined by a series of different elements that describe the character's capabilities. These elements are:

- Characteristics: such as Strength or Charisma

- Attributes: things like Height or Movement

- Skills: expertise in fundamental abilities

Most of these elements are described in terms of numbers, and some are dependent on or calculated by others. What each element means, and how they are determined, is described in the following sections.

## Step 1: Character Concept

A good place to start is to have some idea of what sort of character you want to play: a cunning warrior perhaps, or a wily smuggler. Maybe you prefer a studious academic, or a sagacious magician. Your character concept does not need to be elaborate at this stage; simply an idea that will help guide certain choices such as Culture and Career.

## Step 2: Characteristics

Everyone is defined by seven Characteristics which tell you something about your character; how strong or fast they are; how clever or healthy. Characteristics are at the core of every _Mythras_ _Imperative_ character and form the basis for most of the other elements such as Attributes and Skills. The seven Characteristics are:

- Strength (STR)
- Constitution (CON)
- Size (SIZ)
- Dexterity (DEX)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Power (POW)
- Charisma (CHA)

Before calculating the Characteristics, the following section explains what each represents.

### Strength (STR)

STR represents physical strength: how much one can lift, how hard one can hit, and so on. STR is a component of the Damage Modifier. If a character is reduced to zero STR they lack the ability to move or lift objects.

### Constitution (CON)

CON is measure of health and hardiness. CON is a component in determining Hit Points and Healing Rate. If CON falls to zero for any reason the character dies.

### Size (SIZ)

SIZ measures mass and helps indicate Height and Weight. SIZ is used to help figure Hit Points, as larger, heavier creatures tend to have greater endurance against damage. SIZ can also be used to determine a character's Damage Modifier, since mass helps to increase the force of a blow.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Agility, balance, and reflexes are measured by DEX. It is an important aspect of Action Points and Initiative. If a character is reduced to zero DEX, they suffer functional paralysis.

### Intelligence (INT)

INT is measurement of cognitive ability. Those with a lower INT score are not necessarily stupid, but they are likely to be constrained in how creatively they can employ their wits. INT is a factor in calculating Action Points and Initiative. If INT is reduced to zero, the character becomes completely mindless.

### Power (POW)

POW is a measurement of a character's soul, spirit, inner drive, or capacity for magic. POW governs a character's Magic Points and Luck Points. If a character's POW ever drops to zero, they lose all independent will.

### Charisma (CHA)

Charisma is a measure of presence and personality and is independent of physical appearance. CHA affects a character's Experience Modifier. If CHA ever falls to zero, the character can no longer socially interact with others, becoming so painfully shy or antisocial they are ignored or even driven away.

## Calculating Characteristics

Each Characteristic has a numerical value to determine how potent it is. The number in parentheses after each dice score is the racial average and is used as a gauge to rate your character's results when compared to other members of their species. Suggestions for determining your Characteristics include:

**Dice Roll** : Roll dice for STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA taking each rolled score as it comes. Since the results of these rolls can be somewhat random, it is often better to decide on a character concept after the dice are rolled. Otherwise, the final Characteristics may preclude a preconceived role. Roll 3d6 for STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA; then 2d6+6 for SIZ and INT.

**Dice Roll, Assign** : As above, except the player may exchange values between Characteristics with the same dice range. For example, when rolling up a human, the player could swap values among STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA, as they share a 3d6 range, or between SIZ and INT, which share the 2d6+6 range — but they must always be from the same dice range group; you cannot switch rolls from one group to the other.

**Dice Roll, High** : Roll one extra die as indicated for STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA, and drop the lowest result from each.

**Points Build** : Players assign Characteristic scores from a predetermined pool of 80 points. Characteristics cannot be lower than the minimum rolled value, nor higher than the maximum.

## Step 3: Attributes

Each character also has a set of attributes. These are capabilities derived from the Characteristics or determined by them that are used to govern certain factors of game play.

### Action Points

How often a character can act in a Combat Round is determined by Action Points. All _Mythras_ _Imperative_ characters have 2 Action Points.

### Damage Modifier

Larger and stronger characters and creatures may gain additional damage in certain situations; conversely, weaker and smaller characters may reduce the damage they can inflict. The Damage Modifier is generally used in combat situations but can also be used when attempting to break objects. The Damage Modifier is an extra die roll which is either added to, or subtracted from, the damage inflicted by the weapon or tool. If a negative Damage Modifier takes a weapon's damage to zero or below, then no damage at all has been inflicted.

Add together STR and SIZ and consult the Damage Modifier table, below.

**Damage Modifier**

| STR+SIZ | Damage Modifier |
| :-: | :-:|
| 5 or less | –1d8 |
| 6–10 | –1d6 |
| 11–15 | –1d4 |
| 16–20 | –1d2 |
| 21–25 | +0 |
| 26–30 | +1d2 |
| 31–35 | +1d4 |
| 36–40 | +1d6 |
| 41–45 | +1d8 |
| 46–50 | +1d10 |
| 51–60 | +1d12 |
| 61–70 | +2d6 |
| 71–80 | +1d8+1d6 |
| 81–90 | +2d8 |
| 91–100 | +1d10+1d8 |
| 101–110 | +2d10 |
| 111–120 | +2d10+1d2 |
| Each 10 points | Continue Progression |

### Experience Modifier

Over the course of play characters improve their skills and capabilities. This is achieved using Experience Rolls which are explained in more detail in the [Game System](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0004_Game_System?id=experience-rolls) section.

A character's CHA score may adjust the number of Experience Rolls the character receives, reflecting the relationship they have with their peers and their reputation in the community. With a high CHA people are willing to put themselves out to help train or support the character while they undergo tuition. Conversely, with particularly low CHA, there may be some difficulty improving one's capabilities without the assistance of others; finding someone to spar against for example.

**Experience Modifier**

| CHA | Exp. Modifier |
|:-:| :-:|
| 6 or less | -1 |
| 7-12 | +0 |
| 13-18 | +1 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

### Healing Rate

After receiving injuries, a character needs to recuperate. Healing Rate determines how quickly they naturally recover from wounds. Depending on the severity of the injury, the Healing Rate denotes how many Hit Points are recovered per day, week, or month.

**Healing Rate**

| CON | Healing Rate |
| :-:| :-:|
| 6 or less | 1 |
| 7-12 | 2 |
| 13-18 | 3 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

### Hit Points

Hit Points represent how much injury an area of the body can withstand before it becomes useless, possibly resulting in incapacitation and ultimately the character's death. The body of every creature is divided into separate locations – humans, for example, have seven: the head, chest, abdomen, arms, and legs – each location with its own Hit Points.

Some creatures, such as monsters or different classes of animal, by their very nature often have radically different body structures, yet each location they possess still has Hit Points. When a location's Hit Points are reduced to a certain level through damage of any kind, then the character suffers certain consequences that reflect the severity of the injury. For further information concerning wounds see the [Damage and Wound Levels](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0004_Game_System?id=damage-and-wound-levels) section.

To calculate the Hit Points of each location, add CON and SIZ together and cross-reference the result on the Hit Points table, above.

**Hit Points per Location**

| Location | CON+SIZ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:|
|  | 1–5 | 6–10 | 11–15 | 16–20 | 21–25 | 26–30 | 31–35 | 36–40 | +5 |
| Head | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | +1 |
| Chest | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | +1 |
| Abdomen | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | +1 |
| Each Arm | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | +1 |
| Each Leg | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | +1 |

### Initiative

The moment at which someone reacts in combat is governed by Initiative. Initiative acts as a modifier to Initiative rolls; the higher the Initiative, the faster one responds in a combat situation, determining when you can act. Further factors – armor for example – modify it. The [Combat](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0005_Combat?id=combat-style) chapter goes into more detail on how Initiative is used.

Initiative is the average of the DEX and INT Characteristics.

### Luck Points

Luck Points represent that strange force differentiating adventuring heroes from everyday folk. Call it fate, karma, or simple good fortune. Luck Points can be used to:

- Re-roll the dice if they are unfavorable.
- Mitigate physical damage or other unfortunate circumstances.
- Gain an edge at a vital moment in combat.

Exactly how they are used, and when, is described in the [Game System](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0004_Game_System?id=game-system) section. Once a Luck Point is spent, the pool decreases; when one is out of Luck Points, no more are available – unless the Games Master makes an impromptu award – until the next game session when they replenish to their normal value.

**Luck Points**

| POW | Luck Points |
| :-- | :-: |
| 6 or less | 1 |
| 7-12 | 2 |
| 13-18 | 3 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

### Magic Points

Mystical abilities, powers and spells used in _Mythras_ _Imperative_ usually rely on Magic Points. Since the availability of magic may be limited by a campaign setting or to specific magical professions, some characters will find this Attribute superfluous.

For those who can use such powers, a character's Magic Points are equal to their POW. These points are used to cast spells, the cost of which is dependent on the type of magic used. When casters run out of Magic Points, they have exhausted their ability to cast any spells until Magic Points are replenished.

### Movement Rate

Every creature has a Movement Rate – a number of metres that can be travelled during a specific period of time. Movement is not calculated from Characteristics but is a default value which differs from species to species. The base Movement Rate for humans is 6 metres.

## Step 4: Skills

Skills fall into two classes. Everyone has Standard skills – things such as sneaking around or influencing others. Professional skills on the other hand, are those requiring specific training before they can be attempted – things such as tracking wild animals, piloting spacecraft, or understanding ancient languages. Characters are given three pools of points to spend on acquiring skills; the first pool for the Culture they grew up in, the second for the Career they adopt after childhood, and the last to further round out their skill set. As a default, new characters assign 100 points to the Culture skill pool, 100 to the Career skill pool, and a further 150 Bonus points for rounding out. Each Culture and Career has a defined range of standard and professional skills to which those skill points may be assigned.

_**Combat Style**_ is listed in the Cultural descriptions that follow. Combat Styles are more fully explained in the [Combat](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0005_Combat?id=combat-style) section and have a Basic Percentage equal to STR+DEX.

**Standard Skills**

| Skill | Basic Percentage |
| :-- | :-- |
| Athletics | STR+DEX |
| Boating | STR+CON |
| Brawn | STR+SIZ |
| Conceal | DEX+POW |
| Customs | INT x2, +40\* |
| Dance | DEX+CHA |
| Deceit | INT+CHA |
| Drive | DEX+POW |
| Endurance | CON x2 |
| Evade | DEX x2 |
| First Aid | INT+DEX |
| Influence | CHA x2 |
| Insight | INT+POW |
| Locale | INT x2 |
| Native Tongue | INT+CHA, +40\* |
| Perception | INT+POW |
| Ride | DEX+POW |
| Sing | CHA+POW |
| Stealth | DEX+INT |
| Swim | STR+CON |
| Unarmed | STR+DEX |
| Willpower | POW x2 |

\* Includes a static bonus of +40% for both Customs and the character's Native Tongue (Common for humans).

## Step 5: Culture

Culture determines the kind of society in which the character was raised, and so prescribes certain outlooks and philosophies he or she might have. More practically, culture helps augment the values of the various skills that shape your character's overall capabilities. There are four basic human cultures: Barbarian, Civilized, Nomadic and Primitive. Each cultural background lists a range of Standard skills appropriate to it and invites the player to pick up to three of the presented Professional skills: in this way players from the same cultural background can ensure that their adventurers are different in the areas they have developed. Distribute 100 Culture skill points amongst the career's listed Standard skills and whichever Professional skills were selected, increasing each skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. Games Masters may wish to apply a cap to how many skill points can be applied to any particular skill.

## Barbarian

Tribal in nature, barbarians tend to shun civilization, viewing those who live in large towns and cities as weak and corrupt. Although their own settlements are also sedentary, they tend to be far smaller and closer to nature. Barbarian tribes occupy distinct territories, often half tamed wilderness, which they regard as their own for hunting, grazing, and farming purposes. Most are adept in the use of weaponry as they must overcome many dangers throughout their lives – facing creatures of the wilds or mustering to defend their lands against rival tribes. Since they live in small communities the ties of kinship and clan are strong elements of their society.

#### Skills

_**Standard Skills**_: Athletics, Brawn, Endurance, First Aid, Locale, Perception; and either Boating or Ride. In addition, the player may also choose a cultural Combat Style.

_**Professional Skills**_: Craft (any), Healing, Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigation, Seamanship, Survival, Track.

## Civilized

The Civilized culture is epitomized by a semblance of law and order, underpinned by complex social codes, and supported by a bureaucracy. Civilized people believe themselves superior to all other cultures because their achievements tend toward permanence: sprawling cities, imposing temples, celebratory monuments, and the recording of history and events in books, tombstones, and scrolls. Of course, this is a thin veneer. The most Civilized of cities can be more lawless than any Barbarian frontier settlement; and the social codes may be cruder than the hospitality rituals of nomads. But the Civilized culture prides itself on its achievements, its infrastructure, its professional artisans, and its ability to easily extend its reach to wherever it wishes to go.

#### Skills

_**Standard Skills**_: Conceal, Deceit, Drive, Influence, Insight, Locale, Willpower. In addition, the player may also choose a cultural Combat Style.

_**Professional Skills**_: Art (any), Commerce, Craft (any), Courtesy, Language (any), Lore (any), Musicianship, Streetwise.

## Nomadic

Nomadic people are constantly on the move, with no home and hearth to call their own. They may wander aimlessly about or might have several camps they move to and from throughout the year. They raise few crops and instead follow the migrations of animals or fish, perhaps even herding their own domesticated beasts. Nomads are adept at subsisting on what they can quickly and easily scavenge from their surroundings, letting nothing go to waste. The skills of the nomad culture should be tailored to their environment. Some journey vast distances on foot, others live in caravans or ride strange creatures, and some drift. across the oceans on great floating rafts.

#### Skills

_**Standard Skills**_: Endurance, First Aid, Locale, Perception, Stealth; and two of the following: Athletics, Boating, Swim, Drive or Ride depending on the primary mode of travel. In addition, the player may also choose a cultural Combat Style.

_**Professional Skills**_: Craft (any), Culture (any), Language (any), Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigation, Survival, Track.

## Primitive

Of all peoples, primitives are those that live closest with the land, in tune with its hidden secrets. Living in extended family groups, primitive cultures gather around very simple dwellings that can range from caves and areas of natural shelter through to lean-tos or very basic huts. Primitives are typically hunter-gatherers with either few, or poorly developed, systems for farming and husbandry.

However, certain cultural beliefs, often based on superstitions, can be very well defined. Few primitive cultures have developed anything approaching a written language although paintings and other pictorial symbols serve as a means of communication.

#### Skills

_**Standard Skills**_: Brawn, Endurance, Evade, Locale, Perception, Stealth; and one of either Athletics, Boating or Swim. In addition, the player may also choose a cultural Combat Style.

_**Professional Skills**_: Craft (any), Healing, Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigation, Survival, Track.

## Step 6: Career

Every character starts the game having been trained in a career. The occupation chosen may not necessarily be the one the character continues to follow as the character begins adventuring life, but it is the career embarked on as part of the transition to adulthood and it further defines skill development. Each career presents a range of Standard skills appropriate to it and permits the player to pick up to three of the listed Professional skills. Distribute 100 Career Skill points amongst the career's listed Standard skills and whichever Professional skills were selected, increasing each skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. As with cultures a Games Master may apply a cap to how many skill points can be applied to any particular skill.

Specific Professional skills, like Pilot, are unlikely to be found in a fantasy world. Skills are discussed more fully in the [Skills](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0002_Characters?id=step-4-skills) chapter.

## Step 7: Bonus Skill Points

As a final step, a last pool of 150 skill points is assigned to round out the character. These may be applied to any Standard skill, or those Professional skills gained as part of Culture or Career. Once again, a Games Master may apply a cap to how many skill points can be applied to any particular skill.

### Creating Experienced Characters

It is recommended that beginning characters start fresh, with little or no practical experience. Of course, the level of the characters will depend greatly on the setting and whether the game will be a short one-off adventure or a long-running campaign. It is also common for a player to create a more experienced character if replacing one that has died in play or when joining an existing campaign.

A table is provided, breaking experience into Age Categories. A character's experience has a direct correlation to age and skill competence; more experienced characters naturally have more life experience than their younger compatriots. However, the noted Age Bonus should be treated as approximate, as campaigns advance at different rates — some campaigns have lots of game time pass between adventures while others are one long string of unbroken adventures. When converting an existing character, simply substitute the actual age for that noted on the table.

**Experience Table**

| **Category** | **Age** | **Bonus Skill Points** | **Maximum Skill Increase** |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Young | 10+1d6 | 100 | +10 |
| Adult | 15+2d6 | 150 | +15 |
| Middle Aged | 25+3d6 | 200 | +20 |
| Senior | 40+4d6 | 250 | +25 |
| Old | 60+5d6 | 300 | +30 |

#### Experience Table Notes

- Bonus Skill Points determine how many points the character must spend on developing skills.

- Maximum Skill Increase limits how many of the Bonus Points can be applied to any one Skill.

### The Skill Pyramid

_Mythras Imperative_'s skill point allocation process derives 350 points from three sources: Culture (100), Career (100) and Bonus Skill Points (150). Allocating these points can be time consuming, and there are no doubt times where determining a character's Culture isn't so important, or the player has a particular Occupation in mind that isn't readily served by the templates in the core rules. An alternative system for apportioning skill points, for when time is pressing or when players are eager, is presented here.

Instead of allocating points from the Cultural, Career and Bonus Skill Points pools, the Skills Pyramid is used instead. This divides 350 points into five blocks of fixed points, as follows:

1 skill at 50%, 2 skills at 40%, 3 skills at 30%, 4 skills at 20%, 5 skills at 10%.

Which forms a handy pyramid. Simply cross off each value as it is allocated.

```
    50

   40 40

  30 30 30

 20 20 20 20

10 10 10 10 10
```

### A Few Simple Rules

- All points from the pyramid must be allocated.
- No skill can have more than one allocation from the pyramid.
- Customs and Native Language both gain +40, as per the core rules, and in addition to any allocations made from the pyramid.
- Passions which gain the values noted in the [Passions](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0002_Characters?id=step-8-passions) section, and in addition to any allocations made from the pyramid.
- No skill can exceed 80% from the result of an allocation. So, if a character has STR 16 and DEX 17, for a base of 33%, the player cannot allocate the 50-point value to a Combat Style.
- Six of the values must be allocated to Professional Skills.
- Characters may still choose a Culture and Occupation, and use the skills listed in the appropriate description as a guide for their allocations, or the allocations can be completely freestyle.
- It is recommended that at least one of the values be allocated to a Combat Style, but this isn't mandatory.
- The Games Master always has the final say.

### Larger-Than-Life Heroics

_Mythras Imperative_ deals primarily with normal human beings, but occasionally a campaign requires something else, especially if it demands special heroics, or takes place in a Pulp Action setting, where heroes and villains tend to be larger than life.

Such heroes may not necessarily have superpowers per se (although if these are desired, the Magic and Powers chapter can be used), but they are a bit stronger, a bit faster, a bit more resilient and usually a lot more strong-willed. Think of a certain barbarian from Cimmeria; a special agent who is licensed to kill; a man of bronze; a caped vigilante who is also a billionaire playboy – or any number of popular heroic characters. They frequently face situations where a normal human would crumble; but as heroes, they can withstand whatever the plot throws at them, and live to engage in the next adventure (relatively) unscathed.

If you intend to introduce these character types into your games, then make sure that all players have characters at the same level. These character types are designed to chew the scenery and drive the action; mundane characters (unless they have the benefit of magic, or some other advantage) may well be left in the shade.

### Pulp Hero Characters

These are traditional Pulp Heroes. They aren't superheroes or demigods, and a well-placed shotgun blast will still end their life, but they are tougher, smarter, more able, and in general, a step or two above ordinary people. Also, their lives tend to be filled with adventure. While a Heroic character can choose to attempt to settle down and lead an uneventful life, often trouble or someone in need will find their way to the character's door.

#### Characteristics

When generating Pulp Heroic characters, use the Dice Roll Assign method in the [Characters](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0002_Characters?id=calculating-characteristics) section. Roll 4d6 and discard the lowest die, five times, and then assign the results to STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA. Next, roll 3d6+6 and discard the lowest die twice and assign these numbers to SIZ and INT. If using the Points Build method, players build their character from a preset pool of 90 points.

#### Attributes

These are calculated as per normal, except that Pulp Heroic characters gain two Advantages chosen from the following (note that advantages cannot be stacked):

- +1 Action Point

- +1 Luck Point

- +1 Hit Point to each Hit Location

- Endurance rolls are one Grade easier

- Stealth rolls are one Grade Easier

- Willpower rolls are one Grade easier

All Pulp Heroic characters double their Healing Rate when suffering from Minor or Serious Wounds, although Major Wounds are handled at the character's standard Healing Rate.

#### Skills

Pulp Heroic characters gain an additional 50 Bonus Skill Points to allocate as needed.

### Paragon Characters

Paragon characters are epitomes of excellence. While a certain whip-wielding archaeologist and a licensed-to-kill super-spy are Pulp Heroic characters, that Cimmerian, Man of Bronze, Dark Knight Detective, and Sherlock Holmes are Paragon characters. Paragon characters aren't merely supremely competent in one area of expertise: they usually excel at several. A brilliant inventor and physicist who is also a two-fisted, crack-shot war hero, is an excellent example of a Paragon character; A billionaire playboy crime fighter who studied with the finest detective minds in the world is another. Paragon characters may well have several college degrees, independent wealth, mysterious benefactors, as well as numerous other forms of experience.

As a result, Paragon characters won't be for everyone, but if a setting needs characters who can change the destiny of the entire solar system, or take on any challenge, then a Paragon level campaign fits the bill. While both Ordinary and Heroic campaigns occasionally involve exceedingly high stakes like the fate of nations or even planets, Paragon campaigns should regularly do so.

#### Characteristics

When generating characters using the Dice Roll Assign method in the [Characters](https://srd.mythras.net/#/0002_Characters?id=calculating-characteristics) section. Roll 4d6, discarding the lowest die six times, then assign the five results of your choice (typically, the highest five) to STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA. Next, roll 3d6+6, discarding the lowest die three times and assign the two results of your choice (typically, the highest two) to SIZ and INT. If using the Points Build method, players build their character from a preset pool of 100 points.

#### Attributes

These are calculated as per normal, except that Paragon Characters gain three Advantages chosen from the following (note that advantages cannot be stacked):

- +1 Action Point

- +2 Luck Points

- +2 Hit Points to each Hit Location

- Endurance rolls are one Grade easier

- Stealth rolls are one Grade Easier

- Willpower rolls are one Grade easier

All Paragon characters double their Healing Rate when suffering from Minor or Serious Wounds, although Major Wounds are handled at the character's standard Healing Rate.

#### Skills

Paragon Heroic characters gain an additional 100 Bonus Skill Points to allocate as needed.

## Step 8: Passions

Passions are used to assist players and Games Masters in deepening the nature of the character, introducing plot hooks based on a character's desire or prejudices, and helping the player to understand who his character is, what drives him, and so on.

A Passion can be for anything – a person, an organization, an ideal, even an object. Passions are typically described by a verb such as: Desire, Despise, Destroy, Espouse, Fear, Flee, Forswear, Hate, Love, Loyalty to, Protect, Repudiate, Respect, Seek, Subvert, Torment, or Uphold.

Passions are measured in the same way as skills; they are rated between 1 and 100 (or higher). A Passion can be improved in the same way as a skill, or it can be increased or decreased by the referee depending on circumstances.

Beginning characters may start with up to three Passions, each based on two Characteristics, with a bonus of +40 to the first, +30 to the second and +20 to the third – the player deciding the order of importance. These can be tied to his culture, profession, or personal foibles. For example, in a Sword & Sorcery campaign the character might take: Hate (Stygians), Distrust (Sorcerers), and Desire (Alcohol); whereas in a Dystopian Sci-Fi game the character might choose Loyalty (President), Destroy (Aliens), and Uphold (the Law) instead.

**Passion Table**

| **Object of Passion** | **Starting Percentage** |
| :-- | :-- |
| A person, in a romantic or familial context | POW+CHA |
| An organization or group of people | POW+INT |
| A race or species | Character's POW x2 |
| A place | Character's POW+INT |
| An object or substance | Character's POW x2 |
| A personality trait | Character's POW+CHA |

### Using Passions

A Passion is any deeply held commitment that has the capacity to influence events during play. Although they can be used as stand-alone Abilities (to call them skills is to do them a disservice), Passions are further expanded below to explain in more detail how they work and how they can influence _Mythras_ _Imperative_ characters and campaigns.

In summary, Passions can be used thus:

- To augment another skill, reflecting the depth of one's feelings and how it drives action. When used in this regard, the Passion adds 20% of its value to a skill being used, if the augmentation is thematically and dramatically important.

- As an Ability to drive choices, desires and emotional actions and responses. When used in this way a Standard roll is made against a Passion to determine how strongly the character thinks and feels about something. If a roll is a Success, then the character acts in line with what the Passion would dictate. If the roll Fails, then the character can act freely without feeling constrained by the Passion's drives.

- To oppose other Passions – even those held by the same character. This is typically used where two Passions would conflict. For instance, a personal love might dictate a course of action that would be contrary to an Oath or Loyalty. Here use an Opposed Roll between the two Passions, with the more successful determining how the character acts.

- As a general measure of depth of commitment, belief, and loyalty to a cause. The higher the Passion's value, the more committed the character is. Characters with similar Passions can compare their ratings to determine who exhibits the deeper commitment.

- To resist some form of psychological manipulation or magical domination. In certain cases where a character is being forced into performing an act contrary to their Passions, they may substitute either for Willpower in the Opposed Roll.

New Passions can be developed at any point during a game session if the circumstances warrant it. One might instantly develop 'Hate X' where someone else does something that would strongly invoke hatred to arise. A lord or chief calling for an Oath would immediately establish a Passion of 'Loyalty to X' as soon as that Oath is taken or sworn.

New Passions developed during play in this way cost no Experience Rolls and are established there and then. Of course, characters can also choose to establish a Passion during improvement, at the cost of an Experience Roll to gain a Passion at its Base Value.

### Deepening and Waning

Passions can increase during a game independently of Experience Rolls, based on the strength of whatever occurred to trigger the increase. Also, they can, and do, wane. A strongly held belief can be shaken by many things, leading to that Passion being either reduced or, in more extreme circumstances, reversed completely.

For instance, a character with 'Trust Chieftain' might, if his chieftain acts treacherously, either reduce his Passion or turn into 'Distrust Chieftain' at the same percentage. The Games Master needs to determine whether a Passion reduces or reverses. If it reduces, then it does so according to the strength of the source of the change.

The Deepening and Waning table shows by how much the Passion changes.

**Deepening and Waning**

| **Depth of Change** | **Passion Modified by** |
| --- | --- |
| Weak | 1d10 |
| Moderate | 1d10+5 |
| Strong | 1d10+10 |

## Step 9: Equipment

Now that the character is almost finished, he or she needs some gear. This can include weapons, armor, or other important paraphernalia used for a particular profession. During adventure there are many chances to get more equipment, but each starting character has in his or her immediate possession the following:

- A set of clothing appropriate to the character's profession and the setting.

- An amount of pocket money; enough to last a little while without hardship.

- A personal heirloom, keepsake, or some trinket of little relative value.

- Any trade tools or transportable equipment suitable to the character's profession, if appropriate.

- Any personal weapon for the character's Combat Style.

- Other items as appropriate for the setting, and subject to the GM's approval.
